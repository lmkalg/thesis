# Thesis
This repository holds the results of my thesis presented in order to get my graduation as Bachelor in Computer Science. 

Thanks to a very successful experience as Intern in [ERNW](https://ernw.de/), I was able to finally submit my thesis. 

I was and will always be grateful to the [Computer Deparment of the Univeristy of Buenos Aires](https://www.dc.uba.ar/), which tauch and helped me to build my career. 

In this repository you will find both, an English and Spanish version of my thesis.
